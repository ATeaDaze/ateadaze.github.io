* [x] [TEST] Track number of aces to subtract 10 if over 21
* [x] [TEST] Push when both scores are 21 but not blackjack (currently evaluates on `stand()`)

* [x] Add double down button
  * [x] Disable double down with >= 3 cards

* [ ] Get rid of extraneous code

# BUGS

* [ ] Tie at 21 doesn't evaluate until you stand

  * [ ] Need to optimize fineUniqueCard()
  * [ ] Clean up the card check
  * [ ] Possibly hitting an out-of-range array value
